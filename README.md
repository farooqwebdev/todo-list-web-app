# Todo List Web App

A **modern Todo List application** built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project helped me **learn and implement frontend development concepts** while practicing real-world features like data persistence and UI updates.

## 🌟 Features

- **Add tasks** with a clean and responsive UI  
- **Mark tasks as completed** using a checkbox (line-through effect)  
- **Delete tasks** easily  
- **Persistent storage** using **localStorage** — tasks remain even after refreshing the page or closing the browser  
- **Responsive design** built with Tailwind CSS  

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **HTML5**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
